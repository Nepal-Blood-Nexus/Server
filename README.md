## Description

Nepal Blood Nexus (NBN) is a virtual blood bank project that connects blood donors with recipients in real-time. This Server repository contains the Node.js server code responsible for handling API requests, managing data in MongoDB, and facilitating communication between the client applications and the database.

## Features

- **Express Framework:** Utilizes Express for building robust and scalable APIs.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Interacts with MongoDB to store and retrieve data related to donors, recipients, and other aspects of the blood bank.
- **RESTful API:** Follows RESTful principles to provide a clear and structured API for communication with client applications.
- **Middleware:** Implements middleware for tasks such as authentication, error handling, and request processing.
